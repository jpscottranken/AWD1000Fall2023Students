                <p>Murach's HTML5 and CSS3 provides all HTML and CSS a professional needs, and it 
				adds coverage of Flexible Box and Grid Layout, two new CSS3 ways to implement page 
				layouts. So whether you're a web designer, a JavaScript programmer, a server-side 
				programmer, or a rookie, this book delivers all the HTML and CSS skills that you 
				need on the job. It begins with an 8-chapter hands-on course that teaches you HTML
				and CSS from scratch, including the latest HTML5 and CSS3 features.</p>
                <p>After that, you'll learn how to use Flexible Box and Grid Layout, and how to work 
				with forms and data validation. Then you'll learn how to enhance a site with video 
				clips, CSS3 transitions, transforms, and animations. You'll learn how to design and 
				deploy a website, as well as other professional skills like how to use JavaScript and 
				jQuery and how to use development tools like Bootstrap, SASS, and Emmet. And after 
				you've learned all the skills that you need, this book becomes the best on-the-job 
				reference you've ever used.</p>
