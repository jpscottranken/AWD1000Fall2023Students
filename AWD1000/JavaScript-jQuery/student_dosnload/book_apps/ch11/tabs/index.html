                <p>With this book, you can teach yourself how to design web pages the way the 
                professionals do, by using HTML and CSS in tandem to structure and format the 
                page content. It begins with a crash course that teaches you more about HTML 
                and CSS than you can learn from most full books. That includes a chapter on 
                Responsive Web Design that shows you how to build responsive websites that will 
                look and work right on all devices, from phones to tablets to desktop computers.</p>
                <p>From that point, you can go to any other chapter to learn what you want to 
                know next, like how to work with Flexible Box Layout and Grid Layout, images, 
                tables, forms, audio and video, transitions and animations, and website design 
                and deployment. You can get an overview of using JavaScript and jQuery or third-party 
                tools like Bootstrap and Node.js. And you can turn to the book for answers whenever 
                you need them on the job.</p>
